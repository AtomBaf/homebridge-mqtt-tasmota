# homebridge-mqtt-tasmota
This is an all-in-one homebridge plugin to control various tasmota devices via MQTT.

Since Tasmota MQTT topics are well known for a given device type, all the MQTT topics will be computed according to the device name (%topic% in the tasmota settings).

## Breaking change on 0.4.0
To enable a nice homebridge config UI, only one accessory type has to be defined.
So, now there is only one `mqtt-tasmota` accesory along with a new `type` property.

For instance, a previous accessory definition was like
```
        {
            "accessory": "mqtt-tasmota-blinds",
            "name": "Living Room Blinds",
            "url": "mqtt://192.168.0.3",
            "topic": "living_room_shutter",
            "index": "1"
        },
```
and should be changed to
```
        {
            "accessory": "mqtt-tasmota",
            "type": "blinds",
            "name": "Living Room Blinds",
            "url": "mqtt://192.168.0.3",
            "topic": "living_room_shutter",
            "index": "1"
        },
```

## Tested with
 - Tasmota 9.3.1 Kenneth, 9.4.0 Leslie, 9.5.0 Michael, 10.1.0 Noelle
 - Sonoff devices :
    - RFR3
    - MINI
    - POWR2
    - iFan03
    - S26
    - 4CHPROR2
    - 433 RF Bridge (with smoke alarms)
    - T1 (dual switch)
  - Homemade ESP8266 Temperature sensor

## TODO
 - for malfunctioning devices, get their state at startup and show them as broken
 - create a platform API and enable auto-discover of all tasmota devices
 - add support for power switch
 - add logs for sensors (temp, hum, watt, ...)

## Installation

If you are new to Homebridge, please first read the Homebridge documentation. To install the plugin use:
```
sudo npm install homebridge-mqtt-tasmota -g
```

## Contributing

Adding support for a new device type should be as simple as add a new `device_type.js` file in the `src` directory
Then:
 - add the device type in the main `src/Ã¬ndex.js` file
 - add a dedicated section in the `config.schema.json` file is necessary
