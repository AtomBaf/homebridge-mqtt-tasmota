This is an all-in-one homebridge plugin to control various tasmota devices via MQTT.

Since Tasmota MQTT topics are well known for a given device type, all the MQTT topics will be computed according to the device name (%topic% in the tasmota settings).

## Requirements
 - A MQTT broker (mosquitto for instance)
 - A Tasmota flashed device (v9.3 or up)
 - Homebridge (v1.0.0 or up)

## Tested with
 - Sonoff devices :
    - RFR3
    - MINI
    - POWR2
    - iFan03
    - S26
    - 4CHPROR2
    - 433 RF Bridge (with smoke alarms)
    - T1 (dual switch)
  - Homemade ESP8266 Temperature sensor

## TODO
 - for malfunctioning devices, get their state at startup and show them as broken
 - create a platform API and enable auto-discover of all tasmota devices
 - add logs for sensors (temp, hum, watt, ...)

## Installation

If you are new to Homebridge, please first read the Homebridge documentation.
To install the plugin use:
```
sudo npm install homebridge-mqtt-tasmota -g
```

## Contributing

Adding support for a new device type should be as simple as add a new `device_type.js` file in the `src` directory
Then:
 - add the device type in the main `src/Ã¬ndex.js` file
 - add a dedicated section in the `config.schema.json` file if necessary
