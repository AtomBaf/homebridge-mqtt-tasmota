# homebridge-mqtt-tasmota
This is an all-in-one homebridge plugin to control various tasmota devices via MQTT.

Since Tasmota MQTT topics are well known for a given device type, all the MQTT topics will be computed according to the device name (%topic% in the tasmota settings).


## Tested with
 - Tasmota 9.3.1 Kenneth and 9.4.0 Leslie
 - Sonoff devices :
    - RFR3
    - MINI
    - POWR2
    - iFan03
    - S26
    - 4CHPROR2
    - 433 RF Bridge (with smoke alarms)
    - T1 (dual switch)
  - Homemade ESP8266 Temperature sensor

## TODO
 - for malfunctioning devices, get their state at startup and show them as broken
 - create a platform API and enable auto-discover of all tasmota devices
 - add support for power switch
 - add logs for sensors (temp, hum, watt, ...)

## Installation

If you are new to Homebridge, please first read the Homebridge documentation. To install the plugin use:
```
sudo npm install homebridge-mqtt-tasmota -g
```

## Contributing

Adding support for a new device type should be as simple as add a new ```device_type.js``` file in the ```src``` directory
Then add the device type in the main ```Ã¬ndex.js``` file
