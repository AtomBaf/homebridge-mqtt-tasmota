This is an all-in-one [homebridge](https://homebridge.io/) plugin to control various [tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) devices via MQTT.

Since [tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) MQTT topics are well known for a given device type, all the MQTT topics will be computed according to the device name (`%topic%` in the [tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) settings).

# Requirements
 - A MQTT broker ([mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) for instance)
 - A [tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) flashed device (v9.3 or up)
 - [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io/) (v1.0.0 or up)

# Compatible with
 - [Sonoff devices](https://sonoff.tech/products/) :
    - RFR3
    - MINI
    - POWR2
    - iFan03
    - S26
    - 4CHPROR2
    - 433 RF Bridge (with smoke alarms)
    - T1 (dual switch)
  - Homemade ESP8266 Temperature sensor
  - Generic RGB LED strip controller
  - Probably all other devices supporting [tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/)

# Installation

If you are new to [homebridge](https://homebridge.io/), please first read the [homebridge documentation](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki#installation).
To install the plugin use:
```
sudo npm install homebridge-mqtt-tasmota -g
```

# About the `valve` accessory support
[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) does not have an actual behaviour for an irrigation system or similar system, but it can be setup with some simple rules within the device.

For instance, if I want to setup a faucet that will be triggered by a click, and then will stay `ON` for 30 minutes, I can have these [rules](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Rules/) in [tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/):

```
Rule1
  ON Power1#state=1 DO backlog RuleTimer1 1800; RuleTimer8 10; ENDON
  ON Rules#Timer=1 DO Power1 off ENDON
  ON Rules#Timer=8 DO RuleTimer8 10 ENDON
  ON Power1#state=0 DO RuleTimer0 0 ENDON
;
Rule1 1
```
This will start a timer once the button state changed to `ON`. Then, every 10 seconds a second timer will publish the current timer state to MQTT. This way, the [homebridge](https://homebridge.io/) accessors will be able to display the remaining time left. After 30 minutes the power button will be set to `OFF`.

Furthermore, you can also do a schedule with [timers](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Timers/) to enable automatic irrigation schedule, or like I do, program a swimming pool filtration motor:

```
timers on;
Timer1 {"Enable":1,"Mode":0,"Time":"23:00","Window":0,"Days":"1111111","Repeat":1,"Output":1,"Action":1};
Timer2 {"Enable":1,"Mode":0,"Time":"03:00","Window":0,"Days":"1111111","Repeat":1,"Output":1,"Action":1};
Timer3 {"Enable":1,"Mode":0,"Time":"09:00","Window":0,"Days":"1111111","Repeat":1,"Output":1,"Action":1};
Timer4 {"Enable":1,"Mode":0,"Time":"15:00","Window":0,"Days":"1111111","Repeat":1,"Output":1,"Action":1};
Timer5 {"Enable":1,"Mode":0,"Time":"19:00","Window":0,"Days":"1111111","Repeat":1,"Output":1,"Action":1};
```


# TODO
 - for malfunctioning devices, get their state at startup and show them as broken
 - create a platform API and enable auto-discover of all [tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) devices
 - add logs for sensors (temp, hum, watt, ...)


# Contributing

Adding support for a new device type should be as simple as add a new `device_type.js` file in the `src` directory
Then:
 - add the device type in the main `src/Ã¬ndex.js` file
 - add a dedicated section in the `config.schema.json` file if necessary
